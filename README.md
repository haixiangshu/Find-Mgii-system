# Find-Mgii-system
We use method published in ZHU and MENARD's paper 2018 
You can rudly find doublet of MgII system 
We use double gaussian curve to fit the system, you can roughly estimate the rest equivalent width of each MGII system
The profile named console shows few results of functions from example data.
