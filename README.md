# Find-Mgii-system
We use method published in ZHU and MENARD's paper 2018 
You can rudly find doublet of MgII system 
We use double gaussian curve to fit the system, you can roughly estimate the rest equivalent width of each MGII system
The profile named console shows few results of functions from example data.
Profile myplot are example result of convolve fitting and gaussian fitting.
You can check the correction of MGII system by comparing zmgii with zmgiicorrection1 in the code, in our example the deviation is 2.5%.
